# DS 101 Project 4: Visual Essay

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Setup

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python setup.py
```

(If that doesn't work, try `python3 setup.py`)

The script will automatically:
- Check your Python version
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all required packages (pandas, plotly, jupyter)
- Show you how to get started

### Step 2: Start Working

Every time you work on the project:

**Activate the virtual environment:**
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

**Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
jupyter notebook project_4_template.ipynb
```

**When finished:**
- Close the browser
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- Type `deactivate`

## Troubleshooting

**"python not found"**  
→ Try `python3 setup.py` or install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**"Module not found" error in notebook**  
→ Make sure you activated the virtual environment first

**Setup fails**  
→ Check your internet connection and try again
